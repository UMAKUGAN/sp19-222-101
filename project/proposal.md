Spam Email Classifier.


Our project will be a classifier that determines whether an email is spam or not. In basic terms, the user would upload the text of the email, the REST server sends that to the model, and the REST service returns the answer: spam or not spam. We will be using a dataset that we found at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/spambase. We will write a binary classifier that is trained using this dataset.
