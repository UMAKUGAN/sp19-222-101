###Welcome to Spamalot!

##Introduction
The goal of this project is the creation of a service that can classify
spam emails. By the term "spam email", we refer to emails that are sent with
malicious intent against the recipient. Emails without malicious intent will be
referred to as a "ham email". We are exploring the possibility of predicting
malicious intent in a given email using a machine learning algorithm.

Classifying malicious emails can prevent harmful situations for users who are
unaware of the dangers of phishing. Links in these emails can lead to dangerous
websites or download viruses and other unwanted software, so it is important
to classify spam emails accurately.

It is also important to minimize the number of false positives - i.e. minimize
the number of ham emails that are erroneously labeled as spam. This practice 
would be quite unfriendly to the user.
